## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- [#1464](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1464): Add builder pattern for `MlsGroup`; split `MlsGroupJoinConfig` into `MlsGroupCreateConfig` and `MlsGroupJoinConfig`
- [#1473](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1473): Allow setting group context extensions when building an MlsGroup(Config).
- [#1475](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1475): Fully process GroupContextExtension proposals
- [#1477](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1477): Allow setting leaf node extensions and capabilities of the group creator when creating an MlsGroup(Config)
- [#1478](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1478): Remove explicit functions to set `RequiredCapabilitiesExtension` and `ExternalSendersExtension` when building an MlsGroup(Config) in favor of the more general function to set group context extensions
- [#1479](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1479): Allow the use of extensions with `ExtensionType::Unknown` in group context, key packages and leaf nodes
- [#1488](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1488): Allow unknown credentials. Credentials other than the basic credential or X.509 may be used now as long as they are encoded as variable-sized vectors.
 - [#1527](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1527): CredentialType::Unknown is now called CredentialType::Other.

### Fixed

- [#1503](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1503): Fix `CoreGroup` to check for `LastResortExtension` before deleting leaf encryption keypair from the key store in `new_from_welcome`; this allows the same `KeyPackage` (with last resort extension) to be used to join multiple groups

## 0.5.0 (2023-07-20)

- [#1155](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1155): MlsGroup.members() now returns an iterator over group members, MlsGroup.merge_staged_commit() no longer returns a Result
- [#1193](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/pull/1193): `MlsGroup.propose_self_update` takes the new `LeafNode` now instead of a `KeyPackage`. `LeafNode.generate` can be used to generate a new `LeafNode` for an update proposal.
