A WIP Rust implementation of [Messaging Layer Security](https://github.com/mlswg/mls-protocol/blob/master/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.md) based on draft 9+.

### Supported ciphersuites

- MLS10_128_HPKEX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519 (MTI)
- MLS10_128_DHKEMP256_AES128GCM_SHA256_P256
- MLS10_128_HPKEX25519_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519

### Supported platforms

- linux x86_64
- linux arm32
- linux arm64
- macOS x86_64

### Dependencies

#### Cryptography

OpenMLS does not implement its own cryptographic primitives.
Instead, it relies on existing implementations of the cryptographic primitives used.
There are two different cryptography backends supported right now.

##### Rust Crypto

This is the default cryptographic backend, using the following rust crates: [hkdf], [sha2], [p256], [p384], [x25519-dalek-ng], [ed25519-dalek] [chacha20poly1305], [aes-gcm].


##### Evercrypt

[EverCrypt] provides a formally verified cryptographic backend through the [EverCrypt Rust bindings] to OpenMLS.
The default features have to disabled and the `evercrypt-backend` feature must be enabled.

```
cargo build --features="evercrypt-backend" --no-default-features
```

Note that using this provider restricts OpenMLS usage to the following platforms right now
* Linux x64
* Linux Arm64
* MacOS x64
* Windows x64

⚠️ Note that using this feature tests don't work out of the box.
You need to change the `openmls` dev-dependency in the `Cargo.toml` to use the evercrypt backend as well.

## Development

OpenMLS requires at least Rust 1.50.0.

### Build

- run `cargo build`

### Test

- run `cargo test`

### Benchmark

- run `cargo bench`

## Workspace

This repository is a cargo workspace with the OpenMLS library as the main component.
It further holds the following crates that are used for testing.

### Delivery Service

A basic [delivery service](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-architecture/draft-ietf-mls-architecture.html#name-delivery-service) can be found in [delivery-service/ds](./delivery-service/ds/).
To interact with the delivery service the [ds-lib](./delivery-service/ds-lib/) provides the necessary types.

### Command line Client

A basic command line client can be found in [cli](./cli).
Note that this is a PoC for testing and must not be used for anything else.
