# Release management

The process for releasing a new version of OpenMLS.

## Versioning

The versioning follows the Rust and semantic [versioning guidelines].

## Release Notes

Release notes are published on GitHub with a full changelog and a discussion in
the "Release" section.
In addition, the release notes are prepended to the CHANGELOG file in each crate's
root folder.
The entries in the CHANGELOG file should follow the [keep a changelog guide].

## Pre-release strategy

Before releasing a minor or major version of the OpenMLS crate, a pre-release version
must be published to crates.io.
Pre-release versions are defined by appending a hyphen, and a series of dot-separated identifiers, i.e., `-pre.x` where `x` gets counted up starting at 1.
Pre-releases must be tagged but don't require release notes or other documentation.
It is also sufficient to tag only the most high-level crate being published.

## Release checklist

- [ ] If this is a minor or major release, has a pre-release version been published at least a week before the release?
  - If not, first do so and push the release one week.
- [ ] Describe the release in the CHANGELOG.
- [ ] Create and publish a git tag for each crate, e.g. `openmls/v0.4.0-pre.1`.
- [ ] Create and publish release notes on Github.
- [ ] Publish the crates to crates.io
