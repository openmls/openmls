# User manual

The user manual describes how to use the different parts of the OpenMLS API.

## Prerequisites

Most operations in OpenMLS require a `backend` object that provides all required cryptographic algorithms via the [`OpenMlsCryptoProvider`] trait.
Currently, there are two implementations available through the [openmls_rust_crypto] crate.

Thus, you can create the `backend` object for the following examples using ...

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../openmls/tests/book_code.rs:create_backend_rust_crypto}}
```
