# Processing incoming messages

Processing of incoming messages happens in different phases:

## Deserializing messages

Incoming messages can be deserialized from byte slices into an `MlsMessageIn`:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../openmls/tests/book_code.rs:mls_message_in_from_bytes}}
```

If the message is malformed, the function will fail with an error.

## Processing messages

In the next step, the message needs to be processed. If the message was
encrypted, it will be decrypted automatically. This step performs all syntactic
and semantic validation checks and verifies the message's signature:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../openmls/tests/book_code.rs:process_message}}
```

## Interpreting the processed message

In the last step, the message is ready for inspection. The `ProcessedMessage`
obtained in the previous step exposes header fields such as group ID, epoch,
sender, and authenticated data. It also exposes the message's content. There are
3 different content types:

### Application messages

Application messages simply return the original byte slice:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../openmls/tests/book_code.rs:inspect_application_message}}
```

### Proposals

Standalone proposals are returned as a `QueuedProposal`, indicating that they are pending proposals. The proposal can be inspected through the `.proposal()` function. After inspection, applications should store the pending proposal in the proposal store of the group:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../openmls/tests/book_code.rs:inspect_add_proposal}}
```

### Commit messages

Commit messages are returned as `StagedCommit` objects. The proposals they cover can be inspected through different functions, depending on the proposal type. After the application has inspected the `StagedCommit` and approved all the proposals it covers, the `StagedCommit` can be merged in the current group state by calling the `.merge_staged_commit()` function. For more details, see the `StagedCommit` documentation.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../openmls/tests/book_code.rs:inspect_staged_commit}}
```

### Interpreting remove operations

Remove operations can have different meanings, such as:

- We left the group (by our own wish)
- We were removed from the group (by another member or a pre-configured sender)
- We removed another member from the group
- Another member left the group (by their own wish)
- Another member was removed from the group (by a member or a pre-configured sender, but not by us)

Since all remove operations only appear as a `QueuedRemoveProposal`, the `RemoveOperation` enum can be constructed from the remove proposal and the current group state to reflect the scenarios listed above.

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../openmls/tests/book_code.rs:remove_operation}}
```
