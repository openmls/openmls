*OpenMLS* is a Rust implementation of [Messaging Layer Security](https://github.com/mlswg/mls-protocol/blob/master/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.md) based on draft 12+.
<!-- The introduction of the book imports the lines up until here (line 14), excluding the headline and separately the lines below (starting from line 20). If the line numbers change here, please modify the imported lines in the book.-->

It is a software library that can serve as a building block in applications that require end-to-end encryption of messages.
It has a safe and easy-to-use interface that hides the complexity of the underlying cryptographic operations.

## Supported ciphersuites

- MLS10_128_HPKEX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519 (MTI)
- MLS10_128_DHKEMP256_AES128GCM_SHA256_P256
- MLS10_128_HPKEX25519_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA256_Ed25519

## Supported platforms

OpenMLS is built and tested on the Github CI for the following rust targets.

- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- i686-unknown-linux-gnu
- x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
- i686-pc-windows-msvc
- x86_64-apple-darwin

Additionally, we're building and testing aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu on
[drone.io](https://cloud.drone.io/openmls/openmls).

The Github CI also builds (but doesn't test) the following rust targets.

- aarch64-apple-darwin
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- aarch64-linux-android
- aarch64-apple-ios
- aarch64-apple-ios-sim
- wasm32-unknown-unknown
- armv7-linux-androideabi
- x86_64-linux-android
- i686-linux-android

OpenMLS supports 32 bit platforms and above.

## Cryptography Dependencies

OpenMLS does not implement its own cryptographic primitives. Instead, it relies
on existing implementations of the cryptographic primitives used by MLS. There
are two different cryptography backends implemented right now. But consumers
can bring their own implementation. See [traits](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/tree/main/traits) for more
details.
