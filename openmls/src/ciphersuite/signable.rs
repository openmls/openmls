//! This module defines traits used for signing and verifying
//! structs from the MLS protocol spec.
//!
//! # Type-Enforced Verification
//!
//! This module contains four traits, each describing the property they enable
//! upon implementation: [`Signable`], [`SignedStruct`], [`Verifiable`] and
//! [`VerifiedStruct`].
//!
//! Each trait represents the state of a struct in a sender-receiver flow with
//! the following transitions.
//!
//! * the signer creates an instance of a struct that implements [`Signable`]
//! * the signer signs it, consuming the [`Signable`] struct and producing a [`SignedStruct`]
//! * the signer serializes the struct and sends it to the verifier
//! * the verifier deserializes the byte-string into a struct implementing [`Verifiable`]
//! * the verifier verifies the struct, consuming the [`Verifiable`] struct and producing a [`VerifiedStruct`]
//!
//! Using this process, we can ensure that only structs implementing
//! [`SignedStruct`] are sent over the wire and only structs implementing
//! [`VerifiedStruct`] are used on the verifier side as input for further
//! processing functions.
//!
//! For the type-safety to work, it is important that [`Signable`] and
//! [`SignedStruct`] are implemented by distinct structs. The same goes for
//! [`Verifiable`] and [`VerifiedStruct`]. In addition, only the
//! [`SignedStruct`] should implement the [`tls_codec::Serialize`] trait.
//! Similarly, only the [`Verifiable`] struct should implement the
//! [`tls_codec::Deserialize`] trait.
