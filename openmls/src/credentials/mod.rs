//! # Credentials
//!
//! A [`Credential`] contains identifying information about the client that
//! created it, as well as a signature public key and the corresponding
//! signature scheme. [`Credential`]s represent clients in MLS groups and are
//! used to authenticate their messages. Each
//! [`KeyPackage`](crate::key_packages::KeyPackage) that is either
//! pre-published, or that represents a client in a group contains a
//! [`Credential`] and is authenticated by it.
//!
//! Clients can create a [`Credential`] by creating a [`CredentialBundle`] which
//! contains the [`Credential`], as well as the corresponding private key
//! material. The [`CredentialBundle`] can in turn be used to generate a
//! [`KeyPackageBundle`](crate::key_packages::KeyPackageBundle).
//!
//! The MLS protocol spec allows the that represents a client in a group to
//! change over time. Concretely, members can issue an Update proposal or a Full
//! Commit to update their [`KeyPackage`](crate::key_packages::KeyPackage), as
//! well as the [`Credential`] in it. The Update has to be authenticated by the
//! signature public key contained in the old [`Credential`].
//!
//! When receiving a credential update from another member, applications must
//! query the Authentication Service to ensure that the new credential is valid.
//!
//! Credentials are specific to a signature scheme, which has to match the
//! ciphersuite of the [`KeyPackage`](crate::key_packages::KeyPackage) that it
//! is embedded in. Clients can use different credentials, potentially with
//! different signature schemes in different groups.
//!
//! There are multiple [`CredentialType`]s, although OpenMLS currently only
//! supports the [`BasicCredential`].
