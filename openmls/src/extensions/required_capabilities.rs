//! ## Required Capabilities
//!
//! The configuration of a group imposes certain requirements on clients in the
//! group.  At a minimum, all members of the group need to support the ciphersuite
//! and protocol version in use.  Additional requirements can be imposed by
//! including a `required_capabilities` extension in the GroupContext.
//!
//! ```text
//! struct {
//!     ExtensionType extensions<0..255>;
//!     ProposalType proposals<0..255>;
//! } RequiredCapabilities;
//! ```
//!
//! This extension lists the extensions and proposal types that must be supported by
//! all members of the group.  For new members, it is enforced by existing members during the
//! application of Add commits.  Existing members should of course be in compliance
//! already.  In order to ensure this continues to be the case even as the group's
//! extensions can be updated, a GroupContextExtensions proposal is invalid if it
//! contains a `required_capabilities` extension that requires capabililities not
//! supported by all current members.
