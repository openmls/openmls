/// A `ManagedGroup` represents an [MlsGroup] with
/// an easier, high-level API designed to be used in production. The API exposes
/// high level functions to manage a group by adding/removing members, get the
/// current member list, etc.
///
/// The API is modeled such that it can serve as a direct interface to the
/// Delivery Service. Functions that modify the public state of the group will
/// return a `Vec<MLSMessage>` that can be sent to the Delivery
/// Service directly. Conversely, incoming messages from the Delivery Service
/// can be fed into [process_message()](`ManagedGroup::process_message()`).
///
/// A `ManagedGroup` has an internal queue of pending proposals that builds up
/// as new messages are processed. When creating proposals, those messages are
/// not automatically appended to this queue, instead they have to be processed
/// again through [process_message()](`ManagedGroup::process_message()`). This
/// allows the Delivery Service to reject them (e.g. if they reference the wrong
/// epoch).
///
/// If incoming messages or applied operations are semantically or syntactically
/// incorrect, an error event will be returned with a corresponding error
/// message and the state of the group will remain unchanged.
///
/// The application policy for the group can be enforced by implementing the
/// validator callback functions and selectively allowing/ disallowing each
/// operation (see [`ManagedGroupCallbacks`])
///
/// Changes to the group state are dispatched as events through callback
/// functions (see [`ManagedGroupCallbacks`]).
