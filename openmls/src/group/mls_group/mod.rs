/// [`MlsGroupState`] determines the state of an [`MlsGroup`]. The different
/// states and their transitions are as follows:
///
/// * [`MlsGroupState::Operational`]: This is the main state of the group, which
/// allows access to all of its functionality, (except merging pending commits,
/// see the [`MlsGroupState::PendingCommit`] for more information) and it's the
/// state the group starts in (except when created via
/// [`MlsGroup::join_by_external_commit()`], see the functions documentation for
/// more information). From this `Operational`, the group state can either
/// transition to [`MlsGroupState::Inactive`], when it processes a commit that
/// removes this client from the group, or to [`MlsGroupState::PendingCommit`],
/// when this client creates a commit.
///
/// * [`MlsGroupState::Inactive`]: A group can enter this state from any other
/// state when it processes a commit that removes this client from the group.
/// This is a terminal state that the group can not exit from. If the clients
/// wants to re-join the group, it can either be added by a group member or it
/// can join via external commit.
///
/// * [`MlsGroupState::PendingCommit`]: This state is split into two possible
/// sub-states, one for each Commit type:
/// [`PendingCommitState::Member`] and [`PendingCommitState::Member`]:
///
///   * If the client creates a commit for this group, the `PendingCommit` state
///   is entered with [`PendingCommitState::Member`] and with the [`StagedCommit`] as
///   additional state variable. In this state, it can perform the same
///   operations as in the [`MlsGroupState::Operational`], except that it cannot
///   create proposals or commits. However, it can merge or clear the stored
///   [`StagedCommit`], where both actions result in a transition to the
///   [`MlsGroupState::Operational`]. Additionally, if a commit from another
///   group member is processed, the own pending commit is also cleared and
///   either the `Inactive` state is entered (if this client was removed from
///   the group as part of the processed commit), or the `Operational` state is
///   entered.
///
///   * A group can enter the [`PendingCommitState::External`] sub-state only as
///   the initial state when the group is created via
///   [`MlsGroup::join_by_external_commit()`]. In contrast to the
///   [`PendingCommitState::Member`] `PendingCommit` state, the only possible
///   functionality that can be used is the [`MlsGroup::merge_pending_commit()`]
///   function, which merges the pending external commit and transitions the
///   state to [`MlsGroupState::PendingCommit`]. For more information on the
///   external commit process, see [`MlsGroup::join_by_external_commit()`] or
///   Section 11.2.1 of the MLS specification.

/// Delivery Service. Functions that modify the public state of the group will

/// Service directly. Conversely, incoming messages from the Delivery Service
