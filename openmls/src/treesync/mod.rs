//! This module implements the ratchet tree component of MLS.
//!
//! It exposes the [`Node`] enum that can contain either a [`LeafNode`] or a [`ParentNode`].

// # Internal documentation
//
// This module provides the [`TreeSync`] struct, which contains the state
// shared between a group of MLS clients in the shape of a tree, where each
// non-blank leaf corresponds to one group member. The functions provided by
// its implementation allow the creation of a [`TreeSyncDiff`] instance, which
// in turn can be mutably operated on and merged back into the original
// [`TreeSync`] instance.
//
// The submodules of this module define the nodes of the tree (`nodes`),
// helper functions and structs for the algorithms used to sync the tree across
// the group ([`hashes`]) and the diff functionality ([`diff`]).
//
// Finally, this module contains the [`treekem`] module, which allows the
// encryption and decryption of updates to the tree.
