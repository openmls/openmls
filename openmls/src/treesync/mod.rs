//! This module implements the ratchet tree component of MLS.
//!
//! # About
//!
//! This module provides the [`TreeSync`] struct, which contains the state
//! shared between a group of MLS clients in the shape of a tree, where each
//! non-blank leaf corresponds to one group member. The functions provided by
//! its implementation allow the creation of a [`TreeSyncDiff`] instance, which
//! in turn can be mutably operated on and merged back into the original
//! [`TreeSync`] instance.
//!
//! The submodules of this module define the nodes of the tree (`nodes`),
//! helper functions and structs for the algorithms used to sync the tree across
//! the group ([`hashes`]) and the diff functionality ([`diff`]).
//!
//! Finally, this module contains the [`treekem`] module, which allows the
//! encryption and decryption of updates to the tree.
//!
//! # Don't Panic!
//!
//! Functions in this module should never panic. However, if there is a bug in
//! the implementation, a function will return an unrecoverable
//! [`LibraryError`](TreeSyncError::LibraryError). This means that some
//! functions that are not expected to fail and throw an error, will still
//! return a [`Result`] since they may throw a
//! [`LibraryError`](TreeSyncError::LibraryError).
