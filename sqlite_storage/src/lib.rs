//! # SQLite Storage
//!
//! This crate provides the [`SqliteStorageProvider`] which implements the
//! OpenMLS trait [`StorageProvider`] using the `rusqlite` crate.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Generally, the [`SqliteStorageProvider`] can be used like any other storage
//! provider. However, before first use, the tables need to be created. This can
//! be done using the [`SqliteStorageProvider::create_tables`] method.
//!
//! ### Codec
//!
//! The [`SqliteStorageProvider`] can be instantiated with any codec that make
//! use of the [`Serialize`] and [`DeserializeOwned`] traits of the `serde`
//! crate. The codec is set by implementing [`Codec`] and passing the
//! implementation as generic parameter to the [`SqliteStorageProvider`] upon
//! creation.
//!
//! ## Support
//!
//! The SQLite storage provider currently does not support the `wasm32` target.
