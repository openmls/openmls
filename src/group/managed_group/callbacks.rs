/// Collection of callback functions that are passed to a `ManagedGroup` as part
/// of the configurations. All callback functions are optional.
///
/// ## Validators
///
/// Validator callback functions are called when Proposals are processed through
/// [process_messages()](`ManagedGroup::process_messages()`). If no
/// validator function is specified for a certain proposal type, any
/// semantically valid proposal will be accepted. Validator functions must
/// return a `bool`, that indicates whether the proposal is accepted by the
/// application policy.
///  - `true` means the proposal should be accepted
///  - `false` means the proposal should be rejected
///
/// The validator functions are:
/// ```
/// # use openmls::prelude::{ManagedGroup, Credential};
/// pub type ValidateAdd =
///     fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, sender: &Credential, added_member: &Credential) -> bool;
/// pub type ValidateRemove =
///     fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, sender: &Credential, removed_member: &Credential) -> bool;
/// ```
///
/// ## Auto-save
///
/// The auto-save callback is called whenever the group state was modified and
/// needs to be persisted. The callback function should then call
/// [managed_group.save()](`ManagedGroup::save()`) to persist the group state.
///
/// ```
/// # use openmls::prelude::{ManagedGroup, Credential};
/// pub type AutoSave = fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup);
/// ```
///
/// ## Event listeners
///
/// Event listeners get called when certain messages are parsed, or other events
/// occur. The event listeners are:
/// ```
/// # use openmls::prelude::{ManagedGroup, Credential, Removal, ManagedGroupError, InvalidMessageError, PreSharedKeyID, ReInitProposal};
/// // Membership changes
/// pub type MemberAdded =
///     fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, aad: &[u8], sender: &Credential, added_member: &Credential);
/// pub type MemberRemoved = fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, aad: &[u8], removal: &Removal);
/// pub type MemberUpdated = fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, aad: &[u8], updated_member: &Credential);
/// // PSKs
/// pub type PskReceived = fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, aad: &[u8], psk_id: &PreSharedKeyID);
/// pub type ReInitReceived = fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, aad: &[u8], re_init: &ReInitProposal);
/// // Application messages
/// pub type AppMessageReceived =
///     fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, aad: &[u8], sender: &Credential, message: &[u8]);
/// // Errors
/// pub type InvalidMessageReceived = fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, error: InvalidMessageError);
/// pub type ErrorOccurred = fn(managed_group: &ManagedGroup, error: ManagedGroupError);
/// ```
