//! This module provides the diff functionality for [`TreeSync`].
//!
//! # About
//!
//! This module provides the [`TreeSyncDiff`] struct, that allows mutable
//! operations on otherwise immutable [`TreeSync`] instances. It also provides
//! the [`StagedTreeSyncDiff`] struct, which has to be created from a
//! [`TreeSyncDiff`] before it can be merged in to the original [`TreeSync`]
//! instance.
//!
//!
//! # Don't Panic!
//!
//! Functions in this module should never panic. However, if there is a bug in
//! the implementation, a function will return an unrecoverable
//! [`LibraryError`](TreeSyncDiffError::LibraryError). This means that some
//! functions that are not expected to fail and throw an error, will still
//! return a [`Result`] since they may throw a
//! [`LibraryError`](TreeSyncDiffError::LibraryError).
